    Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. 
    A comment in HTML starts with, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with . For example, the comment  TODO: Remove h1 contains the text TODO: Remove h1


    HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.
    Identify the main section of this page by adding a <main> opening tag after the h1 element, and a </main> closing tag after the p element.

    In the previous step, you nested the h2 element, comment, and p element within the main element. A nested element is a child of its parent element. It should be indented two more spaces than its parent element to improve readability, like this:
    <ul> 
        <li> Child Element 1 </li>
        <li> Child Element 2 </li>
    </ul>
    Add two spaces in front of the three child elements of main so your HTML is more readable.

    Step 7
    You can add images to your website by using the img element. img elements have an opening tag without a closing tag. A tag for an element without a closing tag is known as a self-closing tag.
    Add an img element below the p element. At this point, no image will show up in the browser.
