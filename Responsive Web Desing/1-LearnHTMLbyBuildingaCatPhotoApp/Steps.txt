Step 4
Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. 
A comment in HTML starts with, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with . For example, the comment  TODO: Remove h1 contains the text TODO: Remove h1

Step 5
HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.
Identify the main section of this page by adding a <main> opening tag after the h1 element, and a </main> closing tag after the p element.

Step 6
In the previous step, you nested the h2 element, comment, and p element within the main element. A nested element is a child of its parent element. It should be indented two more spaces than its parent element to improve readability, like this:
<ul> 
    <li> Child Element 1 </li>
   <li> Child Element 2 </li>
</ul>
Add two spaces in front of the three child elements of main so your HTML is more readable.

Step 7
You can add images to your website by using the img element. img elements have an opening tag without a closing tag. A tag for an element without a closing tag is known as a self-closing tag.
Add an img element below the p element. At this point, no image will show up in the browser.

Step 8
HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior. The src attribute in an img element specifies the image's URL (where the image is located). 
An example of an img element using an src attribute: <img src="https://www.your-image-source.com/your-image.jpg">.
Inside the existing img element, add an src attribute with this URL:
https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg

Step 9
All img elements should have an alt attribute. The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load. For example, <img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cat"> has an alt attribute with the text A cat.
Inside the img element, add an alt attribute with this text:
A cute orange cat lying on its back

Step 10
You can link to another page with the anchor (a) element. For example, <a href='https://freecodecamp.org'></a> would link to freecodecamp.org.
Add an anchor element after the paragraph that links to https://freecatphotoapp.com. At this point, the link wonâ€™t show up in the preview.

Step 11
A link's text must be placed between the opening and closing tags of an anchor (a) element. 
For example, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">click here to go to freeCodeCamp.org</a> is a link with the text click here to go to freeCodeCamp.org.
Add the anchor text cat photos to the anchor element. This will become the link's text.

Step 12
Turn the words cat photos located inside p element into a link using the same value for the href attribute as the link below the p element. 
The p element should show the same text in the browser, but the words cat photos should now be a link. Make sure to remove the a element with the text cat photos on the line below the p element.

Step 13
Add a target attribute with the value _blank to the anchor (a) element's opening tag, so that the link opens in a new tab.

Step 14
Turn the image into a link by surrounding it with necessary element tags. Use https://freecatphotoapp.com as the anchor's href attribute value.

Step 15
Before adding any new content, you should make use of a section element to separate the cat photos content from the future content.
Take all the elements currently located within the main element and nest them in a section element.

Step 16
It is time to add a new section. Add a second section element below the existing section element.

Step 17
Within the second section element, add a new h2 element with the text Cat Lists.

Step 18
When you add a lower rank heading element to the page, it's implied that you're starting a new subsection.
After the last h2 element of the second section element, add an h3 element with this text:
Things cats love:

Step 19
After the h3 element with the Things cats love: text, add an unordered list (ul) element. Note that nothing will be displayed at this point.

Step 20
Use list item (li) elements to create items in a list. Here is an example of list items in an unordered list:
<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>cheese</li>
</ul>
Within the ul element nest three list items to display three things cats love:
cat nip laser pointers lasagna

Step 21
After the unordered list, add a new image with an src attribute value set to:
https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg
And its alt attribute value to:
A slice of lasagna on a plate.

Step 22
The figure element represents self-contained content and will allow you to associate an image with a caption.
Nest the image you just added within a figure element.

Step 23
A figure caption (figcaption) element is used to add a caption to describe the image contained within the figure element. For example, <figcaption>A cute cat</figcaption> adds the caption A cute cat.
After the image nested in the figure element, add a figcaption element with text set to:
Cats love lasagna.

Step 24
Emphasize the word love in the figcaption element by wrapping it in an emphasis em element.

Step 25
After the figure element, add another h3 element with the text:
Top 3 things cats hate:

Step 26
The code for an ordered list (ol) is similar to an unordered list, but list items in an ordered list are numbered when displayed.
After the second section element's last h3 element, add an ordered list with these three list items:
flea treatment thunder other cats

Step 27
After the ordered list, add another figure element.

Step 28
Inside the figure element you just added, nest an img element with a src attribute set to https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg.

Step 29
To improve accessibility of the image you just added, add an alt attribute with the text:
Five cats looking around a field.

Step 30
After the last img element, add a figcaption element with the text Cats hate other cats.

Step 31
The strong element is used to indicate that some text is of strong importance or urgent.
In the figcaption you just added, indicate that hate is of strong importance by wrapping it in a strong element.

Step 32
It is time to add a new section. Add a third section element below the second section element.

Step 33
Inside the third section element, add an h2 element with the text:
Cat Form

Step 34
Now you will add a web form to collect information from users.
After the Cat Form heading, add a form element.

Step 35
The action attribute indicates where form data should be sent. For example, <form action="/submit-url"></form> tells the browser that the form data should be sent to the path /submit-url.
Add an action attribute with the value https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo to the form element.

Step 36
The input element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form. Like img elements, input elements are self-closing and do not need closing tags.
Nest an input element in the form element.

Step 37
There are many kinds of inputs you can create using the type attribute. You can easily create a password field, reset button, or a control to let users select a file from their computer.
Create a text field to get text input from a user by adding the type attribute with the value text to the input element.

Step 38
In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the action attribute, you must give the text field a name attribute and assign it a value to represent the data being submitted. 
For example, you could use the following syntax for an email address text field: <input type="text" name="email">.
Add the name attribute with the value catphotourl to your text field.

Step 39
Placeholder text is used to give people a hint about what kind of information to enter into an input. For example, <input type="text" placeholder="Email address">.
Add the placeholder text cat photo URL to your input element.

Step 40
To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, you need to add the required attribute to an input element. 
There's no need to set a value to the required attribute. Instead, just add the word required to the input element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes.

Step 41
Use the button element to create a clickable button. For example, <button>Click Here</button> creates a button with the text Click Here.
Add a button element with the text Submit below the input element. The default behavior of clicking a form button without any attributes submits the form to the location specified in the form's action attribute.


Step 42
Even though you added your button below the text input, they appear next to each other on the page. 
That's because both input and button elements are inline elements, which don't appear on new lines.
You learned previously that the button submits the form by default, but you can explicitly add the type attribute with the value submit to make it clearer. 
Go ahead and do this to specify where this button should submit the form.

Step 43
You can use radio buttons for questions where you want only one answer out of multiple options.
Here is an example of a radio button with the option of cat: <input type="radio"> cat. Remember that input elements are self-closing.
Before the text input, add a radio button with the option set as:
Indoor

Step 44
label elements are used to help associate the text for an input element with the input element itself (especially for assistive technologies like screen readers). 
For example, <label><input type="radio"> cat</label> makes it so clicking the word cat also selects the corresponding radio button.
Nest your radio button inside a label element.

Step 45
The id attribute is used to identify specific HTML elements. Each id attribute's value must be unique from all other id values for the entire page.
Add an id attribute with the value indoor to the radio button. When elements have multiple attributes, the order of the attributes doesn't matter.


Step 46
Nest another radio button with the option Outdoor in a new label element. The new radio button should be placed after the first one. Also, set its id attribute value to:
outdoor

Step 47
Notice that both radio buttons can be selected at the same time. To make it so selecting one radio button automatically deselects the other, both buttons must have a name attribute with the same value.
Add the name attribute with the value indoor-outdoor to both radio buttons.

Step 48
If you select the Indoor radio button and submit the form, the form data for the button is based on its name and value attributes. 
Since your radio buttons do not have a value attribute, the form data will include indoor-outdoor=on, which is not useful when you have multiple buttons.
Add a value attribute to both radio buttons. For convenience, set the button's value attribute to the same value as its id attribute.

Step 49
The fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. fieldset elements are block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line.
Nest the Indoor and Outdoor radio buttons within a fieldset element, and don't forget to indent the radio buttons.

Step 50
The legend element acts as a caption for the content in the fieldset element. It gives users context about what they should enter into that part of the form.
Add a legend element with the text Is your cat an indoor or outdoor cat? above both of the radio buttons

Step 51
Next, you are going to add some new form input elements, so add another fieldset element directly below the current fieldset element.

Step 52
Add a legend element with the text What's your cat's personality? inside the second fieldset element.

Step 53
Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer. For example, here's a checkbox with the option of tacos: <input type="checkbox"> tacos.
Under the legend element you just added, add an input with its type attribute set to checkbox and give it the option of:
Loving

Step 54
Add an id attribute with the value loving to the checkbox input.

Step 55
There's another way to associate an input element's text with the element itself. 
You can nest the text within a label element and add a for attribute with the same value as the input element's id attribute.
Associate the text Loving with the checkbox by only nesting the text Loving in a label element and place it to the right side of the checkbox input element.

Step 56
Add the name attribute with the value personality to the checkbox input element.
While you won't notice this in the browser, doing this makes it easier for a server to process your web form, especially when there are multiple checkboxes.

Step 57
Add another checkbox after the one you just added. The id attribute value should be lazy and the name attribute value should be the same as the last checkbox.
Also add a label element to the right of the new checkbox with the text Lazy. Make sure to associate the label element with the new checkbox using the for attribute.

Step 58
Add a final checkbox after the previous one with an id attribute value of energetic. The name attribute should be the same as the previous checkbox.
Also add a label element to the right of the new checkbox with text Energetic. Make sure to associate the label element with the new checkbox.

Step 59
Like radio buttons, form data for selected checkboxes are name / value attribute pairs. 
While the value attribute is optional, it's best practice to include it with any checkboxes or radio buttons on the page.
Add a value attribute to each checkbox. For convenience, set each checkbox's value attribute to the same value as its id attribute.

Step 60
In order to make a checkbox checked or radio button selected by default, you need to add the checked attribute to it. 
There's no need to set a value to the checked attribute. Instead, just add the word checked to the input element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes.
Make the first radio button and the first checkbox selected by default.

Step 61
Now you will add a footer section to the page.
After the main element, add a footer element.

Step 62
Nest a p element with the text No Copyright - freeCodeCamp.org within the footer element.

Step 63
Make the text freeCodeCamp.org into a link by enclosing it in an anchor (a) element. The href attribute should be set to https://www.freecodecamp.org.

Step 64
Notice that everything you've added to the page so far is inside the body element. 
All page content elements that should be rendered to the page go inside the body element. However, other important information goes inside the head element.
Add a head element just above the body element.

Step 65
The title element determines what browsers show in the title bar or tab for the page.
Add a title element within the head element using the text below:
CatPhotoApp

Step 66
Notice that the entire contents of the page are nested within an html element. All other elements must be descendants of this html element.
Add the lang attribute with the value en to the opening html tag to specify that the language of the page is English.

Step 67
All pages should begin with <!DOCTYPE html>. This special string is known as a declaration and ensures the browser tries to meet industry-wide specifications.
To complete this project, add this declaration as the first line of the code.
