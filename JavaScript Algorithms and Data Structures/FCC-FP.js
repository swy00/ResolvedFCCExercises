//Learn About Functional Programming

/*Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope: 
INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT

Functional programming is about:

Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change

Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output

Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled */

const prepareTea = () => 'greenTea'; // Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea

/*Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the
following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
*/
const getTea = (numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};
const tea4TeamFCC = getTea(40);
