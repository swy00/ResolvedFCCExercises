//Learn About Functional Programming

/*Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope: 
INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT

Functional programming is about:

Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change

Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output

Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled */

const prepareTea = () => 'greenTea'; // Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea

/*Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the
following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
*/
const getTeaa = (numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};
const tea4TeamFCC = getTeaa(40);

//Understand Functional Programming Terminology

/*Callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. You may have seen them passed to other methods, for example in filter, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.

Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called first class functions. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.

The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value are called higher order functions.

When functions are passed in to or returned from another function, then those functions which were passed in or returned can be called a lambda. */

// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareGreenTea = () => 'greenTea';

// Function that returns a string representing a cup of black tea
const prepareBlackTea = () => 'blackTea';

/*
Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the
following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
*/
const getTea = (prepareTea, numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};

const tea4GreenTeamFCC = getTea(prepareGreenTea,27);
const tea4BlackTeamFCC = getTea(prepareBlackTea,13);

console.log(
  tea4GreenTeamFCC,
  tea4BlackTeamFCC
);

/*Understand the Hazards of Using Imperative Code

Functional programming is a good habit. It keeps your code easy to manage, and saves you from sneaky bugs. 
But before we get there, let's look at an imperative approach to programming to highlight where you may have issues.

In English (and many other languages), the imperative tense is used to give commands. 
Similarly, an imperative style in programming is one that gives the computer a set of statements to perform a task.

Often the statements change the state of the program, like updating global variables. 
A classic example is writing a for loop that gives exact directions to iterate over the indices of an array.

In contrast, functional programming is a form of declarative programming. You tell the computer what you want done by calling a method or function.

JavaScript offers many predefined methods that handle common tasks so you don't need to write out how the computer should perform them. 
For example, instead of using the for loop mentioned above, you could call the map method which handles the details of iterating over an array. 
This helps to avoid semantic errors, like the "Off By One Errors" that were covered in the Debugging section.

Consider the scenario: you are browsing the web in your browser, and want to track the tabs you have opened. Let's try to model this using some simple object-oriented code.

A Window object is made up of tabs, and you usually have more than one Window open. The titles of each open site in each Window object is held in an array. 
After working in the browser (opening new tabs, merging windows, and closing tabs), you want to print the tabs that are still open. 
Closed tabs are removed from the array and new tabs (for simplicity) get added to the end of it.

The code editor shows an implementation of this functionality with functions for tabOpen(), tabClose(), and join(). 
The array tabs is part of the Window object that stores the name of the open pages. */

// tabs is an array of titles of each site open within the window
const Window = function(tabs) {
  this.tabs = tabs; // We keep a record of the array inside the object
};

// When you join two windows into one window
Window.prototype.join = function(otherWindow) {
  this.tabs = this.tabs.concat(otherWindow.tabs);
  return this;
};

// When you open a new tab at the end
Window.prototype.tabOpen = function(tab) {
  this.tabs.push('new tab'); // Let's open a new tab for now
  return this;
};

// When you close a tab
Window.prototype.tabClose = function(index) {

  const tabsBeforeIndex = this.tabs.splice(0, index); // Get the tabs before the tab
  const tabsAfterIndex = this.tabs.splice(1); // Get the tabs after the tab

/*Despues de que la segunda linea se ejecuta en la array actual[‘Vimeo’, ‘Vine’], 
siempre va a omitir el primer value (index 0) y el que tiene index 1 hasta el final, llegando a lo que se quiere. */

  this.tabs = tabsBeforeIndex.concat(tabsAfterIndex); // Join them together


  return this;
 };

// Let's create three browser windows
const workWindow = new Window(['GMail', 'Inbox', 'Work mail', 'Docs', 'freeCodeCamp']); // Your mailbox, drive, and other work sites
const socialWindow = new Window(['FB', 'Gitter', 'Reddit', 'Twitter', 'Medium']); // Social sites
const videoWindow = new Window(['Netflix', 'YouTube', 'Vimeo', 'Vine']); // Entertainment sites

// Now perform the tab opening, closing, and other operations
const finalTabs = socialWindow
  .tabOpen() // Open a new tab for cat memes
  .join(videoWindow.tabClose(2)) // Close third tab in video window, and join
  .join(workWindow.tabClose(1).tabOpen());
console.log(finalTabs.tabs);

/*If you haven't already figured it out, the issue in the previous challenge was with the splice call in the tabClose() function. 
Unfortunately, splice changes the original array it is called on, so the second call to it used a modified array, and gave unexpected results.

This is a small example of a much larger pattern - you call a function on a variable, array, or an object, and the function changes the variable or something in the object.

One of the core principles of functional programming is to not change things. Changes lead to bugs. 
It's easier to prevent bugs knowing that your functions don't change anything, including the function arguments or any global variable.

The previous example didn't have any complicated operations but the splice method changed the original array, and resulted in a bug.

Recall that in functional programming, changing or altering things is called mutation, and the outcome is called a side effect. 
A function, ideally, should be a pure function, meaning that it does not cause any side effects.

Let's try to master this discipline and not alter any variable or object in our code.*/

/* Pass Arguments to Avoid External Dependence in a Function

The last challenge was a step closer to functional programming principles, but there is still something missing.
We didn't alter the global variable value, but the function incrementer would not work without the global variable fixedValue being there.
Another principle of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies explicitly. 
This means if a function depends on a variable or object being present, then pass that variable or object directly into the function as an argument.
There are several good consequences from this principle. The function is easier to test, you know exactly what input it takes, and it won't depend on anything else in your program.
This can give you more confidence when you alter, remove, or add new code. You would know what you can or cannot change and you can see where the potential traps are.
Finally, the function would always produce the same output for the same set of inputs, no matter what part of the code executes it.
 */

/* Refactor Global Variables Out of Functions

So far, we have seen two distinct principles for functional programming:
Don't alter a variable or object - create new variables and objects and return them if need be from a function. 
Hint: using something like const newArr = arrVar, where arrVar is an array will simply create a reference to the existing variable and not a copy. 
So changing a value in newArr would change the value in arrVar.
Declare function parameters - any computation inside a function depends only on the arguments passed to the function, and not on any global object or variable.
Adding one to a number is not very exciting, but we can apply these principles when working with arrays or more complex objects. */

// The global variable
const bookList = ["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"];

function add(arr,bookName) {
  let newArr=[...arr];
  newArr.push(bookName);
  return newArr;
}
function remove(arr,bookName) {
  let newArr=[...arr];
  const book_index = newArr.indexOf(bookName);
  if (book_index >= 0) {

    newArr.splice(book_index, 1);
    return newArr;
    }
}

/* Use the map Method to Extract Data from an Array

So far we have learned to use pure functions to avoid side effects in a program. Also, we have seen the value in having a function only depend on its input arguments.
This is only the beginning. As its name suggests, functional programming is centered around a theory of functions.
It would make sense to be able to pass them as arguments to other functions, and return a function from another function. 
Functions are considered first class objects in JavaScript, which means they can be used like any other object. 
They can be saved in variables, stored in an object, or passed as function arguments.
Let's start with some simple array functions, which are methods on the array object prototype. In this exercise we are looking at Array.prototype.map(), or more simply map.

The map method iterates over each item in an array and returns a new array containing the results of calling the callback function on each element. 
It does this without mutating the original array.
When the callback is used, it is passed three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. 
The second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the map method was called.

See below for an example using the map method on the users array to return a new array containing only the names of the users as elements. 
For simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.

const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const names = users.map(user => user.name);
console.log(names);
The console would display the value [ 'John', 'Amy', 'camperCat' ]. */

/* Implement map on a Prototype

As you have seen from applying Array.prototype.map(), or simply map() earlier, the map method returns an array of the same length as the one it was called on. 
It also doesn't alter the original array, as long as its callback function doesn't.
In other words, map is a pure function, and its output depends solely on its inputs. Plus, it takes another function as its argument.
You might learn a lot about the map method if you implement your own version of it. It is recommended you use a for loop or Array.prototype.forEach(). */

const s = [23, 65, 98, 5];

Array.prototype.myMap = function(callback) {

    newArray.push(callback(this[i]));
  }
  return newArray;
};
const new_s = s.myMap(function(item) {
  return item * 2;
});

/* Another useful array function is Array.prototype.filter(), or simply filter().

filter calls a function on each element of an array and returns a new array containing only the elements for which that function returns true. 
In other words, it filters the array, based on the function passed to it. Like map, it does this without needing to modify the original array.
The callback function accepts three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. 
The second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the filter method was called.
See below for an example using the filter method on the users array to return a new array containing only the users under the age of 30. 
For simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.

const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const usersUnder30 = users.filter(user => user.age < 30);
console.log(usersUnder30); 
The console would display the value [ { name: 'Amy', age: 20 }, { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 } ]. */
