Step 8
Time for CSS.
Even though your <div> has no text, it's still treated as a box with content. Write a CSS rule that uses the .canvas class selector and set its width to 500 pixels. Here's a CSS rule that sets the width of the class card to 300 pixels:
.card {
  width: 300px;
}

Step 9
Add the height property with the value 600px to your .canvas rule.

Step 10
Change the background-color of the canvas to #4d0f00.

Step 11
Every painting needs a frame.
Wrap the .canvas element in another div. Give that div the frame class.

Step 15
Use margins to adjust the spacing outside of an element.
Using the margin property, give the .frame element vertical margin of 20px, and horizontal margin of auto. This will move the frame down 20 pixels and horizontally center it on the page.

Step 21
Now .one is centered horizontally, but its top margin is pushing past the canvas and onto the frame's border, shifting the entire canvas down 20 pixels.
Add padding of 1px to the .canvas element to give the .one element something solid to push off of.

Step 22
Adding 1 pixel of padding to the top, bottom, left, and right of the canvas changed its dimensions to 502 pixels x 602 pixels.
Replace the padding property with overflow set to hidden - changing the canvas back to its original dimensions.
